# flutter_project_online_shop

in this project we used these things to impove our coding experience:
 - we used api for recieving data from server.
 - we created database and repository files for managing data.
 - we used BLoC pattern for a better state management and a better separation of concerns.
 - we used multiple packages from pub.dev to make our development process easier.

note that the goods in this app might have totally fake stats, so don't trust them 😁
